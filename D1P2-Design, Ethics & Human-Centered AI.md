### 🎯 Our Approach Today

**We will NOT hype AI agents.**

Instead, we will:
- 🤔 Think critically
- ⚖️ Balance benefits and risks
- 👥 Put humans first
- 🔍 Question assumptions
- 🛡️ Protect what matters

---

## 🌟 What is Human-Centered AI?

### The Core Philosophy

**Human-Centered AI** means designing AI systems that:

```ascii
    🎯 SERVE HUMAN NEEDS
           ↓
    👥 AUGMENT (not replace) human capabilities
           ↓
    🔍 REMAIN TRANSPARENT & UNDERSTANDABLE
           ↓
    ⚖️ RESPECT HUMAN DIGNITY & RIGHTS
           ↓
    🤝 ENABLE HUMAN CONTROL & OVERSIGHT
```

### The Difference

| ❌ Technology-Centered | ✅ Human-Centered |
|----------------------|------------------|
| "What can AI do?" | "What do humans need?" |
| "Let's automate everything!" | "Where does automation truly help?" |
| "AI knows best" | "Humans decide, AI assists" |
| "Faster is always better" | "Better is defined by human values" |
| "Replace expensive humans" | "Empower capable humans" |

### 🎓 Academic Example: Two Approaches to Student Advising

#### ❌ **Technology-Centered Approach**

**University decides:** "AI agent will handle all advising appointments"

**What happens:**
- Students forced to interact with AI
- No option for human advisor
- System optimized for efficiency, not student wellbeing
- Struggling students get automated responses

**Result:** Students feel unheard and unsupported 😞

#### ✅ **Human-Centered Approach**

**University decides:** "AI agent will support advisors and students"

**What happens:**
- AI handles routine questions (course prerequisites, deadlines)
- Identifies students who need human attention
- Advisors focus on complex, personal issues
- Students choose their interaction method

**Result:** Better support for more students 😊

## 🎯 Quiz Time! Understanding Human-Centered Design

Which scenario demonstrates human-centered AI design?

[( )] AI system automatically grades all essays without professor review
[(X)] AI system flags potential issues in essays for professor to review and provide personalized feedback
[( )] AI system replaces office hours with automated Q&A
[( )] AI system makes all curriculum decisions based on data

---

## 🏗️ Human-Centered Design Principles

### 1. 👤 **Put People First**

**Principle:** Start with human needs, not technology capabilities

**In Practice - Research Example:**

**❌ Wrong:** "We have AI that can analyze 10,000 papers per day. Let's use it!"

**✅ Right:** "Researchers struggle to stay current with literature. How can AI help with this specific problem?"

### Real Scenario: Dr. Mariam's Challenge

**Dr. Mariam** (History Professor) says:
> "I don't need to read 10,000 papers. I need to deeply understand 50 relevant ones and teach my students critical analysis skills."

**Human-centered solution:**
- AI curates and ranks papers by relevance
- Highlights key debates and perspectives
- Suggests connections between sources
- **Dr. Mariam** reads, analyzes, and teaches critical thinking

**Time saved:** Used for deeper engagement, not just "more"

---

### 2. 🔍 **Maintain Transparency**

**Principle:** People should understand how AI makes decisions

```ascii
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│     THE TRANSPARENCY SPECTRUM           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│  🚫 BLACK BOX                           │
│  "AI decided. Don't ask why."           │
│                                         │
│  ⚠️  OPAQUE                             │
│  "AI uses complex algorithms."          │
│                                         │
│  📊 INTERPRETABLE                       │
│  "AI ranked these based on X, Y, Z."    │
│                                         │
│  ✅ TRANSPARENT                         │
│  "Here's exactly how AI reached         │
│   this conclusion, and here's the       │
│   data it used."                        │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 🎓 University Example: Admissions Decision

**Scenario:** University uses AI to help evaluate applications

#### ❌ **Non-Transparent Approach**

"The AI scored this applicant 6.7/10"

- **Why that score?** Unknown
- **What factors mattered?** Mystery
- **Can we contest it?** No basis to do so
- **Legal implications?** Potentially serious

#### ✅ **Transparent Approach**

"The AI scored this applicant 6.7/10 based on:
- Academic record: 7.5/10 (GPA, test scores)
- Essays: 6.0/10 (clarity, originality)
- Recommendations: 7.0/10 (strength, specificity)
- Activities: 6.5/10 (leadership, commitment)

**Human reviewer** examines score, context, and makes final decision with full understanding."

---

### 3. 🤝 **Enable Human Control**

**Principle:** Humans must remain in control and able to override AI

### The Control Spectrum

```markdown
| Level | Human Role | AI Role | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|---------|
| 🟢 **Full Control** | Decides everything | Provides information | AI shows research papers; professor selects |
| 🟡 **Shared Control** | Approves AI suggestions | Recommends actions | AI suggests course topics; professor approves |
| 🟠 **Monitored Automation** | Can intervene | Executes with oversight | AI schedules rooms; staff can override |
| 🔴 **Full Automation** | Informed after fact | Decides and acts | AI automatically fails students ❌ |
```

**Rule for Academia:** Never use 🔴 Full Automation for consequential decisions!

### Real Scenario: Plagiarism Detection

**Georgian University Case Study:**

**Old system (🔴 Full Automation):**
- AI automatically marks assignments as plagiarized
- Student gets zero
- Professor sees result later

**Problems:**
- AI flagged student quoting course readings properly
- AI couldn't understand Georgian language nuances
- Student's grade harmed unfairly

**New system (🟡 Shared Control):**
- AI flags potential issues
- Professor reviews each case
- Considers context, language, discipline conventions
- **Professor** makes final decision

**Result:** More accurate, fairer outcomes

---

### 4. 🎨 **Design for Dignity**

**Principle:** AI should respect and enhance human dignity

**What this means:**
- 🚫 Don't reduce people to data points
- 🚫 Don't make people feel worthless
- ✅ Acknowledge human complexity
- ✅ Preserve meaningful human interaction
- ✅ Support human growth and learning

### Example: Student Feedback

#### ❌ **Dignity-Harming Approach**

AI feedback on student essay:

> "This essay is poorly written. Score: 3/10. You ranked in bottom 5% of class. AI suggests you are not suited for this subject."

**Impact:** Student feels humiliated, loses confidence, may drop out

#### ✅ **Dignity-Preserving Approach**

AI-assisted feedback reviewed by professor:

> "Your essay shows good effort in tackling complex ideas. Here are specific areas to strengthen:
> 
> 1. Thesis clarity - let's work on making your main argument more explicit
> 2. Evidence integration - you have good sources, let's connect them more clearly
> 3. Conclusion - try restating why this matters
>
> I see potential here. Let's discuss in office hours. - Prof. Levan"

**Impact:** Student has path forward, maintains dignity, stays engaged

---

## 🎯 Quiz Time! Apply Design Principles

Your university wants to use AI to predict which students might drop out. Which approach is most human-centered?

[( )] AI automatically sends warning letters to low-scoring students
[( )] AI creates a public dashboard ranking students by dropout risk
[(X)] AI privately alerts advisors to check in personally with students showing concerning patterns
[( )] AI emails students their dropout probability percentage

---

## ⚖️ Key Ethical Concerns

### 1. 🎭 **Bias and Fairness**

**The Problem:** AI learns from historical data, which contains human biases

```ascii
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         HOW BIAS ENTERS AI               │
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                          │
│  📊 BIASED DATA                          │
│  (Historical discrimination patterns)    │
│           ↓                              │
│  🤖 AI LEARNS PATTERNS                   │
│  (Reproduces biases automatically)       │
│           ↓                              │
│  ⚡ BIASED DECISIONS                     │
│  (Amplifies existing inequalities)       │
│           ↓                              │
│  🔄 FEEDBACK LOOP                        │
│  (Creates more biased data)              │
│                                          │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 🎓 Real Academic Example: Hiring Bias

**Scenario:** University uses AI to screen faculty applications

**What happened (Real story from international university):**

- AI trained on 10 years of hiring data
- Historical hires were 75% male in engineering
- AI learned: "male candidates are better fits"
- AI automatically downranked female applicants
- **Result:** Perpetuated gender inequality

**Root cause:** Not the AI itself, but biased historical data

### 🇬🇪 Georgian Context Example

**Scenario:** AI grading system for essays

**Potential bias:**
- Trained mostly on Tbilisi university data
- May disadvantage students from regional universities
- May not understand regional dialects or expressions
- Could favor writing styles common in capital

**Solution:** 
- Diverse training data from all regions
- Human review of AI assessments
- Regular bias audits
- Multiple assessment methods

---

### 2. 🔐 **Privacy and Data Protection**

**The Concern:** AI agents need data to function, but whose data? How is it used?

### Data Privacy Principles

```markdown
| Principle | What It Means | Academic Example |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| 🎯 **Purpose Limitation** | Only collect data for specific, stated purposes | Collect grades for advising, not for unrelated research |
| 📊 **Data Minimization** | Collect only what's necessary | Need student performance data, not their medical history |
| 🔒 **Security** | Protect data from unauthorized access | Encrypt student records, limit access |
| ⏰ **Retention Limits** | Don't keep data forever | Delete after student graduates + required period |
| 👤 **User Rights** | People can access, correct, delete their data | Students can see and correct their AI profile |
```

### 🚨 Real Scenario: Privacy Violation

**What happened:**

Georgian university implemented "student success" AI:
- Tracked students' library visits
- Monitored online learning logins
- Analyzed social media (if public)
- Combined with grade data

**Student discovers:**
- AI created detailed behavioral profile
- Shared with multiple departments
- Students never clearly consented
- No way to see or correct their profile

**Outcome:**
- Student complaints
- Privacy authority investigation
- System suspended
- University fined

**Lesson:** Transparency and consent are not optional!

---

### 3. 🎓 **Academic Integrity**

**The Question:** Does AI help or harm genuine learning?

### The Spectrum of Use

```ascii
✅ ENHANCES LEARNING          |  ❌ UNDERMINES LEARNING
                               |
📚 Research assistance        |  🚫 Essay generation
🔍 Finding sources            |  🚫 Automated homework
💡 Brainstorming ideas        |  🚫 Taking exams via AI
✍️ Editing feedback           |  🚫 Pretending AI work is yours
📊 Data analysis support      |  🚫 Fabricating research data
🗣️ Language learning help     |  🚫 All translation with no learning
```

### Real Scenario: The Cheating Dilemma

**Professor Nino's Class (Literature):**

**Assignment:** "Write analysis of Georgian modernist poetry"

**Student A:** Uses AI to:
- Generate complete essay
- Submits without reading sources
- Learns nothing

**Student B:** Uses AI to:
- Find lesser-known poems
- Check understanding of complex passages
- Get feedback on draft argument
- Write final essay themselves

**Question:** Both used AI. One cheated, one learned. How do we tell the difference?

**Answer:** **Intent, transparency, and learning outcomes matter**

---

### 4. ⚖️ **Accountability**

**The Critical Question:** When AI makes a mistake, who is responsible?

### The Accountability Gap

```ascii
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│    WHO IS RESPONSIBLE WHEN AI FAILS?    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│  🤖 The AI?                             │
│  → No - it's a tool, not a person       │
│                                         │
│  💻 The Developer?                      │
│  → Maybe - but they're far away         │
│                                         │
│  🏢 The University?                     │
│  → Partly - they chose to use it        │
│                                         │
│  👤 The User (Professor/Staff)?         │
│  → Partly - they applied it             │
│                                         │
│  📋 Clear Answer?                       │
│  → Often missing! This is the gap.      │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 🎓 Real Case: Grade Appeal

**What happened:**

- AI agent assists with grading
- Student receives failing grade
- AI made calculation error
- Student appeals: "AI was wrong!"
- University: "Who do we hold accountable?"

**Options:**

1. **Blame the student?** ❌ They didn't use AI
2. **Blame the professor?** ⚠️ They trusted the AI
3. **Blame the AI company?** ⚠️ They sold the tool
4. **Blame the university?** ⚠️ They implemented it

**Right answer:** **Clear accountability structure must exist BEFORE using AI**

### Accountability Framework

```markdown
| Decision Type | AI Role | Human Responsible | Review Process |
|--------------|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| Course grades | Assists calculation | Professor verifies | Student can appeal to dean |
| Admissions | Ranks applications | Committee decides | Appeals board reviews |
| Research misconduct | Flags patterns | Ethics board investigates | Full due process |
| Resource allocation | Suggests optimization | Administration approves | Faculty senate reviews |
```

## 🎯 Quiz Time! Ethical Reasoning

A university uses AI to monitor student emails for mental health crisis keywords and automatically alerts counseling services. What's the PRIMARY ethical concern?

[( )] The AI might make technical errors
[(X)] Privacy violation without informed consent
[( )] The AI might miss some cases
[( )] Cost of the AI system

---

## 🧠 The Big Question: Minds or Tools?

### Do AI Agents Think?

**Three Perspectives:**

#### 1. 🤖 **"AI Has Artificial Minds"**

**View:** AI agents genuinely understand and reason

**Arguments:**
- They solve problems creatively
- They learn from experience
- They generate novel ideas
- They pass many intelligence tests

**Counterargument:** 
- They don't truly "understand" - they pattern-match
- They lack consciousness
- They can't feel or genuinely care

---

#### 2. 🔧 **"AI Are Sophisticated Tools"**

**View:** AI agents are powerful instruments with no real understanding

**Arguments:**
- They manipulate symbols without meaning
- They can't generalize beyond training
- They lack genuine creativity
- They're deterministic machines

**Counterargument:**
- The output seems indistinguishable from understanding
- Does it matter if they "truly" understand?

---

#### 3. 🤝 **"AI Are Partners" (Most Practical View)**

**View:** Doesn't matter if they "think" - focus on effective collaboration

**Arguments:**
- Treat them as cognitive partners
- Combine their strengths with human strengths
- Focus on outcomes, not philosophy
- Design for effective human-AI teaming

**This is the approach we recommend for academia**

╚═══════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### Real Example: Teaching Philosophy

**Professor Giorgi teaches Ethics:**

**❌ Wrong approach:** "AI can teach ethics now. I'm not needed."

**✅ Right approach:** "AI can:
- Present ethical scenarios quickly
- Show diverse perspectives
- Check understanding of concepts

**But I must:**
- Guide moral reasoning development
- Model ethical thinking process
- Create safe space for difficult discussions
- Help students apply ethics to real life
- Be present for genuine dialogue"

**Result:** More time for what matters most - human development

---

## ⚖️ Pros and Cons: The Honest Assessment

### ✅ Benefits of AI Agents in Academia

#### 1. ⏰ **Efficiency Gains**

**Real data from pilot universities:**
- Administrative tasks: 40% time reduction
- Literature reviews: 60% faster initial screening
- Routine student questions: 24/7 instant response

**But:** Efficiency ≠ Better outcomes automatically

---

#### 2. 📊 **Scale and Access**

**Example:** One professor can now:
- Provide initial feedback to 200 students
- Monitor learning analytics across courses
- Maintain office hours support overnight

**But:** At what cost to depth and personal connection?

---

#### 3. 🎯 **Personalization**

**Possibility:** AI can adapt to each student's:
- Learning pace
- Preferred style
- Knowledge gaps
- Interests

**But:** Risk of algorithmic filter bubbles

---

#### 4. 🔍 **Data-Driven Insights**

**Examples:**
- Identify struggling students early
- Spot curriculum gaps
- Understand learning patterns
- Evidence-based improvements

**But:** Numbers don't capture everything important

---

### ❌ Risks and Drawbacks

#### 1. 🎭 **Dehumanization**

**Risk:** Students become data points

**Real concern:**
- Reduced face-to-face interaction
- Loss of mentorship relationships
- Students feel processed, not educated
- Education becomes transactional

**Story from Georgian University:**

> "I tried to discuss my grandmother's illness with my advisor, but was directed to the AI chatbot. The bot gave me policy information. What I needed was human understanding and flexibility. I felt like a problem to be solved, not a person to be supported." - Student testimonial

---

#### 2. 🧠 **Skill Atrophy**

**Risk:** Over-reliance on AI reduces human capabilities

**Concerns:**
- Students don't develop critical thinking if AI answers everything
- Researchers lose literature analysis skills
- Academics stop developing intuition
- "Use it or lose it" applies to cognitive skills

**Real scenario:**
- Students can't write without AI
- Lost ability to formulate own ideas
- Struggle when AI unavailable (exams)

---

#### 3. 💸 **Cost and Inequality**

**Reality check:**

**Costs:**
- AI systems: €20,000 - €500,000/year
- Training: Time and resources
- IT infrastructure: Upgrades needed
- Maintenance: Ongoing expense

**Result:**
- Wealthy universities pull ahead
- Poor universities fall behind
- Inequality widens
- Two-tier system emerges

---

#### 4. 🔒 **Vendor Lock-in**

**Risk:** Dependence on private companies

**Concerns:**
- University data in corporate servers
- Subscription costs increase yearly
- Can't switch systems easily
- Features changed without consent
- Academic freedom compromised?

---

#### 5. ⚠️ **Errors and Hallucinations**

**Reality:** AI agents make mistakes confidently

**Real examples:**
- AI cites nonexistent research papers

**Proposal:**
AI agent analyzes student performance, personality tests, and labor market data to recommend career paths. Students receive "career match score" for different professions.

**Your task:** Identify risks and benefits

**Consider:**
- Bias: Historical labor market discrimination in data?
- Determinism: Should AI predict futures?
- Agency: Does this limit student choices?
- Accuracy: Can AI predict career success?
- Transparency: Can students understand recommendations?
- Human role: What's the advisor's role?

---

#### Scenario C: Research Misconduct Detection

**Proposal:**
AI agent continuously scans all research output for potential plagiarism, data fabrication, and ethical violations. Automatically flags suspicious cases to ethics committee.

**Your task:** Evaluate appropriateness

**Consider:**
